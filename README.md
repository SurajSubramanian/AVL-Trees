# AVL Trees

## Introduction

Consider the case when the following values are inserted in order into a Binary Search Tree : 1, 2, 3, 4
This would generate a skewed BST as follows :

<img src="./images/skewedBST.png" alt="Skewed BST"
	title="Skewed BST" width="150" height="100" />

Such a tree is not desirable since the complexities of all the operations are Linear 

| Operation     |  Cool  |
| ------------- | -----: |
|     Search    |  O(n)  |
|     Insert    |  O(n)  |
|     Delete    |  O(n)  |
